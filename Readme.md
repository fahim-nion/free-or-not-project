## Project Description

**"My university busy schedule for friends and they don’t have time to meet with each other."**

Life at university can get extremely busy, and finding a common time to hang out with friends can be a challenge. Everyone is juggling their own schedules with classes, projects, and extracurricular activities. This project provides a way to quickly check when your friends are free during the day, based on their academic schedules.
